<p>For New Leaf Digital, we thought that it would be helpful to have our own short URL, where we could provide easy links to members, sponsors, and presenters.  Once I saw that <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> Enterprise cost <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-vanity-URL-shorteners-cost">$995 per month</a> for vanity URLS, I thought that I could find a better solution.</p>

<p>To begin with, I bought the URL nld.to.</p>

<p>I found (YOURLS)[https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS], which is a PHP/MySQL-based URL shortener.  I already had an (Amazon Lightsail)[https://amazonlightsail.com] Ubuntu box that was idle ($5 per month), so I set it up on there.</p>

<p>As a note, the YOURLS software does not create a homepage (index.php), so if you visit, there will be errors.  If you instead visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>http://nld.to/cwn (CoWorking Night)</li>
  <li>http://nld.to/3210 (32/10 Young Professionals)</li>
  <li>http://nld.to/donate (Donate to New Leaf!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only major thing that I ran into was that there were errors creating a few of the tables with MariaDB on 16.04.  I worked through the issue by following this (Github Issue)[https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/2125], in particular the following command got the tables to create properly.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>MariaDB [yourlsdb]&gt; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS yourls_url (keyword varchar(200) BINARY NOT NULL,url text BINARY NOT NULL,title text CHARACTER SET utf8,timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,ip VARCHAR(41) NOT NULL,clicks INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (keyword), KEY timestamp (timestamp), KEY ip (ip))
-&gt; ENGINE=MyISAM;
</code></pre>
</div>
